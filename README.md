In the modern era, integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the field of sports has become essential as optimizing performance and rehabilitation is crucial for athletes. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) plays crucial role by providing real-time insights into muscle function as coaches and scientists aim to enhance training schedules and prevent injuries of athletes. Monitoring sEMG is also critical in rehabilitation as it allows personalized recovery programs and assesses the muscle reactivation post-injury. Despite advancements, the existing sEMG systems often lack real-time feedback and ease of use. This highlights the need for innovative solutions as they must offer comprehensive data analysis and seamless integration with other digital tools.
This thesis addresses these needs by developing an advanced IoT-based real-time monitoring system designed to detect muscle fatigue using sEMG sensors. The system utilizes sEMG sensors integrated with an Arduino-based platform for collecting and processing muscle activity data. Two algorithms from the bibliography were implemented, one that utilizes Median Power Frequency (MPF) to monitor changes in muscle activation, while the other computes a fatigue index based on a trigger step, following an analysis in the frequency domain. The device was tested on the Vastus Medialis muscle during isometric leg-extension exercises with different participants across multiple sessions. An application was also developed to permit real-time data visualization and analysis through a user-friendly interface. The results demonstrate the system's efficiency in providing real-time feedback in order to optimize athletic performance and enhancing rehabilitation processes. The data analysis capabilities, combined with the integration of IoT technologies, highlight the potential of this kind of system to significantly advance sports science and athlete management. By offering immediate insights into muscle fatigue, the system empowers athletes and also healthcare providers to make informed decisions, thereby improving training outcomes and rehabilitation efficiency.
